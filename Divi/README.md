## Overview

- Created on: June 18th, 2021
- This is a sample website that I found on divi and was able to replicate everything except the font sizes/families/weights. I did actually design it mobile first then added a tablet media query and a desktop media query.

## What I learned

I learned the power of grid. Seriously. Once I finished the base (mobile first) styling, all i had to do was add tablet and desktop media queries, adjust grid's grid-template-columns for both media queries, and set the grid-template-rows for a few of the grid-items.



## What I struggled with

This was honestly one of the smoothest projects I've worked on. The most difficult part was just keeping track of the grid-items when I was styling them.
